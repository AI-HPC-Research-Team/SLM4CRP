# Scientific Language Modeling (SLM4Mol): A Quantitative Review of Large Language Models in Molecular Science

This analysis offers a comprehensive review of Transformer models and Large Language Models (LLMs) in molecular modeling and design. Large language models (LLMs) offer a fresh approach to tackle scientific problems from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective, introducing a research paradigm called scientific language modeling (SLM). However, two key issues remain: how to quantify the match between model and data modalities and how to identify the knowledge-learning preferences of models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal benchmark, named ChEBI-20-MM, and perform 1263 experiments to assess the model's compatibility with data modalities and knowledge acquisition. Through the modal transition probability matrix, we provide insights into the most suitable modalities for tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a statistically interpretable approach to discover context-specific knowledge mapping by localized feature filtering.

**Paradigm of the Review**:
- **a. Molecular Modeling and Design Tasks**: Showcasing six task types, their standard modeling methods, and data examples.
- **b. Processes of Tasks**: Dividing molecular data into internal and external categories. Internal information is key to molecular representation and can be converted via various tools, while external information is more accessible and comprehensible to humans. This section outlines the research scope, detailing inputs and outputs for each task.

**Note**: The ChEBI-20-MM benchmark and model sections detail respective directories. Some data and checkpoints might not be available due to size constraints and permissions.

## ChEBI-20-MM
We introduce ChEBI-20-MM, a multi-modal benchmark developed from the ChEBI-20 dataset, integrating data like InChI, IUPAC, and images for a diverse range of molecular tasks.

## Analysis of Model Knowledge-Learning Preferences
Our analysis aims to discern model preferences for knowledge acquisition. To enhance interpretability, we focus on the IUPAC-to-caption mapping process, which is closely aligned with natural language tasks. Figure. a displays the token mapping matrix after normalization and rearrangement based on the total counts of rows and columns, selecting the top 20 high-frequency chemical tokens in IUPAC names and captions. General high-frequency mappings, such as oxy, methyl, and hydroxy, appear extensively across various tokens. Traditional filtering methods might capture many of these mappings yet potentially exclude those with specific contextual significance.

To find specific high-frequency mapping pairs, as shown in Figure. b, at T = 2.788, the Z-test reaches its maximum value of 2.405, corresponding to a confidence level of 98.2%. After identifying 21 specific token mapping pairs and removing those with identical row and column names, we are left with 16 unique pairs. By consolidating mappings with the same leading or trailing tokens, we obtain the following 9 groups of token mappings:

- `['ent']` → `['methyl']`
- `['lan', 'phospho']` → `['phosphat']`
- `['ace']` → `['amino']`
- `['ryl']` → `['acy', 'ate', 'acid', 'conjug']`
- `['hydr']` → `['one']`
- `['cycl']` → `['hydroxy', 'one']`
- `['phen']` → `['group']`
- `['min']` → `['ine']`
- `['hydroxy']` → `['acid', 'mono']`

These mapping patterns illustrate the diversity and specificity of chemical token relationships captured through our analysis. Following these mapping patterns, we randomly select corresponding molecular IUPAC names and their captions, as shown in Figure. c.

- **a. IUPAC-to-Caption Tokens Mapping Matrix of T5.** This matrix presents the performance in text generation and property prediction tasks. The vertical axis represents input modalities, while the horizontal axis
denotes output modalities.
- **b. Threshold T Analysis.** There are 100 thresholds within the range [0,3] for T . As the threshold increases, the criteria for selecting
specific high-frequency pairs become more stringent, reducing their number while also affecting significance levels.
- **c. Examples of T5 Knowledge-Learning Preferences.**
